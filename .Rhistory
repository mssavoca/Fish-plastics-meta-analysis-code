# Results
*First order model*
Here we see a few significant relationships:
*Biology*
**Size** negative correlation with DD
Reproductive strategy
*Human Use*
Human use in general (any use)
**Type of fishery** (**commercial - negative correlation**, gamefish, aquaculture)
Fisheries (any fishery)
*Ecology*
**Geographic range** positive corr. with Arctic Ocean (note small sample size); negative corr. with Indian Ocean
Latitude/temperature (tropical/temperate)
**Habitat** (**benthic - positive correlation**, deepwater, pelagic, coastal, **freshwater - negative correlation**)
**Depth range** (**0-200 m - negative correlation**, 201-1000 m, **1000+ m- negative correlation**)
*Let's summarize what this all means. In general, we are seeing that larger sharks are less likely to be data deficient, as are species targeted by fisheries specifically, rather than just human use in general. In terms of habitat, sharks are less likely to be data deficient if they are found in the Indian Ocean, in freshwater, and either in the photic zone or at depths of greater than 1000 m. Note that there may be an influence of sample size in some of these cases.*
*In contrast, highly vulnerable species are more likely to be data deficient. Sharks in the Arctic are also more likely to be data deficient, although we have a small sample size for this. Interestingly, although sharks at depths of greater than 1000 m are LESS likely to be data deficient, benthic species are likely to be. These two characteristics are not necessarily correlated, as benthic species could reside at all depths, depending on whether they are coastal or deep water.*

# Results
*First order model*
Here we see a few significant relationships:
*Biology*
**Size** negative correlation with DD
Reproductive strategy
*Human Use*
Human use in general (any use)
**Type of fishery** (**commercial - negative correlation**, gamefish, aquaculture)
Fisheries (any fishery)
*Ecology*
**Geographic range** positive corr. with Arctic Ocean (note small sample size); negative corr. with Indian Ocean
Latitude/temperature (tropical/temperate)
**Habitat** (**benthic - positive correlation**, deepwater, pelagic, coastal, **freshwater - negative correlation**)
**Depth range** (**0-200 m - negative correlation**, 201-1000 m, **1000+ m- negative correlation**)
*Let's summarize what this all means. In general, we are seeing that larger sharks are less likely to be data deficient, as are species targeted by fisheries specifically, rather than just human use in general. In terms of habitat, sharks are less likely to be data deficient if they are found in the Indian Ocean, in freshwater, and either in the photic zone or at depths of greater than 1000 m. Note that there may be an influence of sample size in some of these cases.*
*In contrast, highly vulnerable species are more likely to be data deficient. Sharks in the Arctic are also more likely to be data deficient, although we have a small sample size for this. Interestingly, although sharks at depths of greater than 1000 m are LESS likely to be data deficient, benthic species are likely to be. These two characteristics are not necessarily correlated, as benthic species could reside at all depths, depending on whether they are coastal or deep water.*
